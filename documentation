***********************School Management App Documentation***********************
1. Introduction
This documentation outlines the development and functionality of the School Management app built
using Flutter and Dart.
The purpose of the app is to help students and administrators manage school-related activities. The
app provides several features including viewing posts from an admin dashboard, displaying an
agenda, and interacting with a chatbot.
For the database, Supabase is used to manage the app's data. The app is still in development, and
future updates will continue to improve and expand its functionality.
2. App Flow and Pages
The app consists of four main pages:
1. **First Page (Splash Page)**: This page contains an image, text, and a 'Get Started' button. When
the button is clicked, it navigates to the home page.
2. **Home Page**: This page displays posts fetched from an admin's dashboard built with Flask.
The posts are dynamically displayed to the user.
3. **Agenda Page**: This page uses WebView to display the emploi (schedule) in an easy-to-read
format.
4. **Report Page**: This page contains a chatbot integrated with Tawk.to. The chatbot has been
trained to provide answers to user queries, especially related to the school environment.
3. Technical Details
Technologies used in the development of this app:
1. **Flutter and Dart**: The app is developed using the Flutter framework with Dart as the
